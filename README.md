**Summer Internship Projects**

Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam

Duration: May 2025 – July 2025

**🏢 About IGCAR**

This repository documents the projects completed during my Summer Internship at
Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu.

IGCAR is one of India’s premier nuclear research centers under the
Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.
The institute focuses on advanced reactor technology, instrumentation, and nuclear research.

During my internship, I worked on embedded systems, signal processing, and GUI-based data acquisition systems.
